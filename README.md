## File Formats

The file format is created by saving a file and contains information about the structure of data contained in a file, its purpose and affiliation. Application software can use the information available in the file format to interpret the data and make the contents available. The format of a file is added to the actual name with an appropriate extension. This consists of a point and two to four letters.

With so-called proprietary formats, the files can only be opened, edited and saved with the associated application, auxiliary or system programs (e.g. .doc/.docx, .xls/.xlsx). Open formats (e.g. .html, .jpg, .mp3, .gif), on the other hand, make it possible to open and edit the file with software from different manufacturers.

File formats can be actively changed by conversion when saving, but data loss can occur. In the scientific field, particular attention should be paid to compatibility, suitability for long-term archiving and lossless conversion to alternative formats.

What is the importance of file formats in research data management?

A **file format** is a way of encoding information within a computer file. When a programme or an application wants to use a file, it needs to recognise the file format so that it can access the content within a file. One of the most common ways to recognise a file format is to look at the **file name extension**. Usually this is represented by three or four characters at the end of the file name after a full stop.

When you start planning your project, it is important to consider the file formats that you will use throughout your research. Sometimes the **choice of a format is influenced by norms** within your research discipline. For instance, by commonly used **software programmes** or file formats that you and your colleagues have used in the past. Or, the choice might also depend on the type of **hardware** or **instrument** you will use. In other situations, choosing a specific format might limit the possibility to collaborate with other scientist who don’t have access to the same software tools.

And last but not least, **certain file formats are less future proofed** than others. We often refer to this problem as **file format obsolescence**. And there are several reasons for this to happen. For example, sometimes older versions of a file format are no longer supported by **newer versions of the software**. Or, the software supporting the format is no longer available or cannot be used in newer operating systems. So, choosing the appropriate file format has implications doing your research project, but also for the long-term **usability of your data**.

All file formats are vulnerable to **obsolescence** to a certain degree. However, the sustainability of a file format can increase when you use what we call **open and standard formats**. Remember that a file format describes the way in which information is stored and organised within a computer file. If this description, known as **file format specification**, is available for anyone to see and free of charge, then we talk about **open file formats**. When a specification is not publicly available or there are limitations on how it can be reused, we talk about **closed formats**.

Let’s have a closer look. **Closed** formats, often called **proprietary formats**, are usually developed for commercial software applications. These files might only be readable with the same software used to create them for which licences is needed. Files produced with one version of the software might not be compatible with older or newer versions. Because the use of closed file formats depends on a specific software package or even a specific version of a software, they are **more vulnerable to obsolescence**. In other words, closed formats are less sustainable.

**Open file formats** can be both, proprietary and non-proprietary. Sometimes they are developed and maintained by a commercial company. But most often they are released by a standardisation body or a community without commercial interest. In any case, the file format specifications are open, which means that anyone can potentially develop software packages or applications that can use these formats, maximising the **interoperability and reuse** of information they contain. Besides, **compatibility with older versions** of the format is a priority. Making these types of formats **less subject to obsolescence issues**. So, in general open and non-proprietary formats are more sustainable when it comes to preserving data.

But sometimes we don’t have a choice but to use closed formats. In such cases it is good practice to also create a **copy of your files in an open format** to increase the chances of your data being accessible in the long term.

Actually, **file format conversion** might be needed at any moment of your research. For example, to use the data with a different software package or to share it with others. However, you should realise that converting files from one format to another might result in a **loss of content, metadata or quality**.

Before you **migrate files** to another format, it is important to be aware the **risks** and to test what can go wrong. It is also good practice to **keep the original files**, so you can always return to them and repair any errors or changes in your data if something goes wrong with your file conversion.

When choosing a file format, it might also be important to check what kind of **compression** is used. Compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.

There are two types of compression. **Lossless compression** allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. When a file is compressed using this method, uncompressing it again results in a file that is identical to the original file.

But there are also **lossy types of compression** where some of the content is lost. Before performing a lossy compression, it is advisable to do some research to understand what compression parameters should be used. The objective should be to retain the critical information needed to make your files **reusable**.

As you can see, there are a few things to consider when it comes to file formats. To get started you can access a list of recommended formats via our website. Take a look!

## Data Management Plan (DMP)

Creating a Data Management Plan (DMP) for any research project is considered good scientific practice and increasingly mandated by research stakeholders. (Early) Planning for [Research Data Management (RDM)](#Research-Data-Management-%28RDM%29) can save a lot of time, money and problems in the long run and will therefore increase scientific integrity and transparency. **The content of a DMP covers core topics such as data description, documentation, metadata & standards, data storage & security, sharing & reuse, legal & ethical issues as well as responsibilities & costs related to research data management.**

The time for submission of the DMP depends on the individual requirements of institutions or funders. Generally, a DMP should be seen as a **living document** that starts as light version and grows gradually until submission of the full or final DMP version at the end of the project. Institutions or funders may provide special DMP templates or recommendations for DMP tools such as DMPonline or RDMO for the creation of a DMP.

**Transcript:**<!-- style="color: black; font-size: 20px;" -->

A data management plan or DMP is a document that outlines how research data will be handled during and after a research project. Creating a DMP is considered good practice for any research project that will use or generate data. Decisions made early on affect what you can do later, so good and timely planning can save you a lot of time and problems in the longer run. It also helps you consider the necessary resources and costs for data management - so you can budget for these and even include them in your grant applications. Planning can also help you to increase the FAIRness of your data and to make data FAIR by design. Data management plans are increasingly required by research institutions and funding agencies. These stakeholders recognize the intrinsic value of data and intend to increase scientific integrity and transparency and the accessibility and reuse of data collected by publicly funded research.

So what should be included in a data management plan?

If you are writing a DMP for your institution or funder it is important to check if a specific template is available or even required. Although DMP templates might slightly vary from organization to organization they usually cover the following topics: a summary or description of the data. You will need to indicate whether you will generate new data or use existing data sets and provide some basic characteristics about them - such as their origin, their type, their format and estimated size.

Metadata and documentation: what information will be provided to make data understandable and findable? And will this be provided following agreed standards?

Other DMP questions will deal with data storage and security: where will the data be stored? And how will you ensure that data is protected against risks? For example data loss due to human errors, computer failures or malicious attacks. And how to make sure that it cannot be accessed, deleted or modified by unauthorized persons? What about preservation? What data will be preserved after the end of the project? For how long and where?

Sharing and Reuse: what data can and will be shared? With whom and under which access and reuse conditions or licenses? Where and when will data be made available?

Another content block involves the possible legal or ethical issues related to your project's data. For example if you work with personal or otherwise confidential data, or any other situation where ethical approval is needed. Or if you work with third party data or you are planning to seek patent protection for your research results. These are all issues that will affect how you should collect, store and process your data and whether you can share them or not and under which conditions.

Responsibility should also be addressed: who bears the overall responsibility for implementing and regularly updating the dmp? Who is responsible for each of the different data management activities including documenting, storage and backups, preserving and sharing data?

And finally what about costs and resources? Are there any costs related to the implementation of the dmp? Will you need additional resources to cover these costs?

So that's for the content of a DMP but when are you supposed to submit a DMP? Well, it depends on the specific requirements of your institution or research funder. Usually, the life cycle of a data management plan looks like this: the proposal stage: this is where the various requirements diverge most. Your institution or funder might not have any specific requirements with regards to data management. Another possibility is that the proposal needs to address some RDM questions or include a light version of a DMP. In other cases, a preliminary but full version of the DMP might be required. When your project is approved. A first version of the DMP will usually be required shortly after - often no later than six months after the start date - but things can change over the course of the project. Or maybe certain things were not known at the beginning - that is why you are supposed to keep your DMP up to date throughout the course of the project. In some cases updated versions might be a deliverable with a specific deadline. At the end of the project it is likely that a final version of the DMP is requested - this should reflect the final decisions and approaches taken. For some funders the final DMP might be part of the project's final evaluation.

As we've mentioned, many institutions or research funders will provide a DMP template with a series of RDM related questions. However, there is a range of tools that can help you with the process of creating a data management plan. These tools will incorporate these templates. They will also provide you with some tips as you go along and allow you to export your final DMP in a format ready for submission. So before you start - check whether your institution provides a DMP tool. For example researchers from Ghent university and other belgian institutions can use dmponline.be. In our website you can find more information about data management plans and a video tutorial about dmponline.be. Why don't you have a look?

**Quiz**<!-- style="color: black; font-size: 20px;" -->

Why should you write a DMP?

      [( )] because it is a new requirement of the Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF)
      [(X)] primarily to increase my sienctific integrity and because my institution or funders may ask for it
      [( )] no, it generally does not make sense writing a DMP because it is just an additional administrative burden

What topics should be included in a DMP?

      [(X)] how you will deal with storage and sharing of your research data
      [( )] a detailed cost listing of salaries and consumables
      [( )] administrative information of your former publications

When should you start writing a DMP?

      [( )] when the project is finished and almost published
      [(X)] best before the project starts because then you can properly plan the handling of your research data throughout the whole project lifecycle
      [( )] funders normally ask for it after publication of the research results

## FAIR Data vs. Open data

**FAIR Data**

[FAIR](#FAIR-Principles) stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable and refers to sustainable research data management. The main goal of the FAIR data principles is to optimise the preparation of research data, making it findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.

**Open Data – Free primary research data**

The free availability and usability of data on the web is often referred to as open data. It is data that has been made available without any restriction for free use, further dissemination and free reuse. Various licences can be used to identify data as open data.

**The FAIR Principles and Open Data**

FAIR data is not the same as open data. For example, it is not always possible to grant free access to data for economic and legal reasons. Restrictions on access are compatible with FAIR principles, as long as the conditions and ways of access are evident.

**Duration:** 2:09 min

**Content:** This video explains the difference between data that complies with the FAIR data principles and open data, which is freely accessible to anyone.

**Transcript:**<!-- style="color: black; font-size: 20px;" -->

No matter what kind of research you do or where you are in your career, sooner or later you will come across the FAIR principles for research data. Applying the [FAIR principles](## FAIR Principles) means to make your research data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Findable means that others can discover your data. Accessible means that your data can be made available to others. Interoperable means that your data can be integrated with other data or can be easily used by machines. Reusable means that your data can be used for new research. These four principles should be applied throughout the entire data life cycle and they are closely interconnected.

Please note applying the FAIR principles to your research workflows does not necessarily mean that you share your data openly. FAIR data is not the same as open data. Open data is data that can be freely used, shared and built on by anyone anywhere and for any purpose, while the FAIR principles provide a set of best practices for sharing data respecting any ethical, legal or contractual restrictions. If your data contains personal information or is subject to copyrights or intellectual property rights you must comply with regulations and protect your data from unauthorized access. But even if the data itself cannot be shared openly, you should create and publish a description of your data so that researchers with a relevant purpose can request permission to reuse the data.

This module introduces you to best practices for making your data FAIR. Following these best practices will help you to produce high quality data that can result in maximizing your research output and impact and enhancing your recognition as a researcher.

**Quiz**<!-- style="color: black; font-size: 20px;" -->

What does the acronym FAIR stand for?

    [(X)] Findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable
    [( )] Factorial, analysable, informative, recognizable
    [( )] Fair, accurate, inclusive, respectful

Which statement about Open Data is correct?

    [(X)] Open Data means information that is freely accessible.
    [( )] With Open Data, only data that is related to a scientific interpretation can be considered.
    [( )] With Open Data, the availability and usability of data on the web is limited.

FAIR data is always open data

    [( )] True
