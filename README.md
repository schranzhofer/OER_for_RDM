## File Formats

The file format is created by saving a file and contains information about the structure of data contained in a file, its purpose and affiliation. Application software can use the information available in the file format to interpret the data and make the contents available. The format of a file is added to the actual name with an appropriate extension. This consists of a point and two to four letters.

With so-called proprietary formats, the files can only be opened, edited and saved with the associated application, auxiliary or system programs (e.g. .doc/.docx, .xls/.xlsx). Open formats (e.g. .html, .jpg, .mp3, .gif), on the other hand, make it possible to open and edit the file with software from different manufacturers.

File formats can be actively changed by conversion when saving, but data loss can occur. In the scientific field, particular attention should be paid to compatibility, suitability for long-term archiving and lossless conversion to alternative formats.

What is the importance of file formats in research data management?

A __file format__ is a way of encoding information within a computer file. When a programme or an application wants to use a file, it needs to recognise the file format so that it can access the content within a file. One of the most common ways to recognise a file format is to look at the __file name extension__. Usually this is represented by three or four characters at the end of the file name after a full stop.

When you start planning your project, it is important to consider the file formats that you will use throughout your research. Sometimes the __choice of a format is influenced by norms__ within your research discipline. For instance, by commonly used __software programmes__ or file formats that you and your colleagues have used in the past. Or, the choice might also depend on the type of __hardware__ or __instrument__ you will use. In other situations, choosing a specific format might limit the possibility to collaborate with other scientist who don’t have access to the same software tools.

And last but not least, __certain file formats are less future proofed__ than others. We often refer to this problem as __file format obsolescence__. And there are several reasons for this to happen. For example, sometimes older versions of a file format are no longer supported by __newer versions of the software__. Or, the software supporting the format is no longer available or cannot be used in newer operating systems. So, choosing the appropriate file format has implications doing your research project, but also for the long-term __usability of your data__.

All file formats are vulnerable to __obsolescence__ to a certain degree. However, the sustainability of a file format can increase when you use what we call __open and standard formats__. Remember that a file format describes the way in which information is stored and organised within a computer file. If this description, known as __file format specification__, is available for anyone to see and free of charge, then we talk about __open file formats__. When a specification is not publicly available or there are limitations on how it can be reused, we talk about __closed formats__.

Let’s have a closer look. __Closed__ formats, often called __proprietary formats__, are usually developed for commercial software applications. These files might only be readable with the same software used to create them for which licences is needed. Files produced with one version of the software might not be compatible with older or newer versions. Because the use of closed file formats depends on a specific software package or even a specific version of a software, they are __more vulnerable to obsolescence__. In other words, closed formats are less sustainable.

__Open file formats__ can be both, proprietary and non-proprietary. Sometimes they are developed and maintained by a commercial company. But most often they are released by a standardisation body or a community without commercial interest. In any case, the file format specifications are open, which means that anyone can potentially develop software packages or applications that can use these formats, maximising the __interoperability and reuse__ of information they contain. Besides, __compatibility with older versions__ of the format is a priority. Making these types of formats __less subject to obsolescence issues__. So, in general open and non-proprietary formats are more sustainable when it comes to preserving data.

But sometimes we don’t have a choice but to use closed formats. In such cases it is good practice to also create a __copy of your files in an open format__ to increase the chances of your data being accessible in the long term.

Actually, __file format conversion__ might be needed at any moment of your research. For example, to use the data with a different software package or to share it with others. However, you should realise that converting files from one format to another might result in a __loss of content, metadata or quality__.

Before you __migrate files__ to another format, it is important to be aware the __risks__ and to test what can go wrong. It is also good practice to __keep the original files__, so you can always return to them and repair any errors or changes in your data if something goes wrong with your file conversion.

When choosing a file format, it might also be important to check what kind of __compression__ is used. Compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.

There are two types of compression. __Lossless compression__ allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. When a file is compressed using this method, uncompressing it again results in a file that is identical to the original file.

But there are also __lossy types of compression__ where some of the content is lost. Before performing a lossy compression, it is advisable to do some research to understand what compression parameters should be used. The objective should be to retain the critical information needed to make your files __reusable__.

As you can see, there are a few things to consider when it comes to file formats. To get started you can access a list of recommended formats via our website. Take a look!


__Quiz__<!-- style="color: black; font-size: 20px;" -->

## Data Management Plan (DMP)

Creating a Data Management Plan (DMP) for any research project is considered good scientific practice and increasingly mandated by research stakeholders. (Early) Planning for [Research Data Management (RDM)](## Research Data Management (RDM)) can save a lot of time, money and problems in the long run and will therefore increase scientific integrity and transparency. __The content of a DMP covers core topics such as data description, documentation, metadata & standards, data storage & security, sharing & reuse, legal & ethical issues as well as responsibilities & costs related to research data management.__

The time for submission of the DMP depends on the individual requirements of institutions or funders. Generally, a DMP should be seen as a __living document__ that starts as light version and grows gradually until submission of the full or final DMP version at the end of the project. Institutions or funders may provide special DMP templates or recommendations for DMP tools such as DMPonline or RDMO for the creation of a DMP.
