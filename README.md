# Open Educational Resources for Research Data Management (OER_for_RDM)

## Description
The collection of open educational resources (OER) on the following 
pages was created by the Training Task Force in 2021 as part of the FAIR Data Austria project (BMBWF, 2020-2022). 
The collection consists of selected OER enhanced by further information and interactive elements to provide an 
introduction to the following nine topics:

* File Format
* Data Management Plan (DMP)
* FAIR Data vs. Open data
* FAIR Principles
* Research Data Management (RDM)
* Metadata
* Open Science
* Persistent Identifier (PID)
* Publication of data

The pages or the individual elements can be reused to create informational 
and training materials on research data management.
